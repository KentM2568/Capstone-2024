					<h2>My Passion For Engineering</h2>
					<p>
					Engineering is a pretty broad interest, but the main aspects of it that I love are the computer science aspect and the robotics/design aspect.
					
					</p>
					<h2>Computer Science</h2>
					<p>
					I have been coding personally for over 5 years, on my own time and with friends. 
					I have a basic to intermediate knowledge of:
					</p>
					<ul> 
						
						<li><a id="linkhover" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">Object Oriented Programming</a> </li>	
						<li><a id="linkhover" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Python</a> </li>
						<li><a id="linkhover" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a> </li>
						<li><a id="linkhover" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank">C++</a> </li>
						<li><a id="linkhover" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a> </li>
						<li><a id="linkhover" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a> </li>
						

					</ul>
					
					<p> 
					What I love about programming is the freedom it gives me. 
					The bounds of what someone can do with programming are near limitless, when it comes to manipulating technology to ones needs.
					If you want, you can make a video game to play, like I did in 2021 for the entire summer when I made a game called Hermes Domain.
					Early on in my learning about programming, I was motivated to make a video game in the unity engine.
					Hermes Domain is the fruits of many failed attempts to do so, and it is still not fully fleshed out.
					The <strong>  <a id="linkhover" href="https://github.com/KentM2568/Hermes-Domain/tree/main" target="_blank"> github page </a> </strong>  is currently archived, as I have not done any work on it in 2 years.
					More recently, I learned a lot about Java and C++, which showed me more practical uses of code, outside of video games.
					I am continuing to learn and expand my skills in this domain, as there are limitless possibilities, and endless avenues on the path of knowledge for me to  travel.		
					</p>
					<h2>FIRST Robotics</h2>
					<p>
					In the fall of 2021, to the late spring of 2022 I was in the Earl Marriott First robotics team Tech Mates 8082. 
					We were still a bit active in 2023, but we did not participate in the competition that year.
					Over the initial ~3 month period between October and December 2021, I was introduced to the Tech Mates robotics team at our school.
					I had never done anything like this in the past, so it piqued my interest.
					On January 8th 2022, the game for the 2022 First Robotics competition was revealed, and the build season started.
					During the 2 months between early January and early March, along with the rest of the Tech Mates robotics team, I designed, built, and programmed a 115 pound robot.
					This was an extremely intensive engineering challenge, requiring many hours of time investment, but in the end our robot was able to go to the <strong> <a id="linkhover" href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2022bcvi" target="_blank">  2022 Canadian Pacific Regionals Competition </a> </strong> to represent team 8082. 
					In the end, we along with our alliance made it to second place in the competition, losing out in the finals matches, but still going home with a trophy.					
					</p>
					<h2>My Future With Engineering</h2>
					<p>
					I absolutely love engineering and I wish to pursue it as a career in the future, but not to just work mindlessly, I want to be an entrepreneur. 
					I plan to go to university to expand my skills in business and engineering, and I go into further detail about my future plans on my <strong> <a id="linkhover" href="about.html">about</a> </strong> page.
